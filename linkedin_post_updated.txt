🔬 Visualizing Market Structure with Network Filtering - Now with Dynamic Layouts!

I'm excited to share a major update to my open-source implementation of geometric network filtering methods for financial correlation matrices, based on the groundbreaking research of Tomaso Aste (UCL), Tiziana Di Matteo (King's College London), and Rosario Mantegna (University of Palermo).

👷‍♂️ Work in progress. ⚠️ Testing phase. 📝 Comments welcome.

🎬 NEW: Dynamic Force-Directed Layouts!

The big update: nodes now MOVE as correlations evolve! Instead of static positions, nodes naturally migrate toward/away from each other based on changing correlation structure. Watch clusters form and dissolve in real-time as market conditions change.

Think of it as seeing the "breathing" of market correlations - strongly correlated assets pull together, weakly correlated ones drift apart. It's intuitive, engaging, and reveals dynamics that static visualizations miss.

📊 What does this do?

Financial markets generate massive correlation matrices - for 500 stocks, that's 124,750 correlations, most of which are noise. This code implements three powerful geometric filtering methods to extract the meaningful structure:

• MST (Minimum Spanning Tree): Hierarchical backbone with N-1 edges
• PMFG (Planar Maximally Filtered Graph): Richer structure with 3(N-2) edges  
• TMFG (Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph): Fast O(N²) computation

🎯 Dynamic vs Static Layouts:

Dynamic Layout (NEW!):
✓ Nodes move with force-directed physics
✓ See correlation structure evolve visually
✓ Perfect for presentations and teaching
✓ Adjustable smoothing and spacing

Static Layout:
✓ Fixed node positions
✓ Easy to track individual assets
✓ Better for technical analysis
✓ Faster computation

🛠️ The Code Creates:

✓ Synthetic time series with realistic evolving correlations
✓ Rolling correlation estimation with configurable windows
✓ Animated visualizations with dynamic OR static layouts
✓ Side-by-side method comparisons
✓ MP4 exports ready for presentations

Simple to use:
```python
animator = NetworkAnimator(dynamic_layout=True)
animator.animate_filtered_networks(
    correlations,
    filter_method='pmfg',
    smoothing_factor=0.3  # Control movement smoothness
)
```

💡 Why Dynamic Layouts Matter:

Traditional network visualizations show topology but miss the temporal evolution. With dynamic layouts, you literally see:

• Crisis periods: Networks suddenly contract as everything correlates
• Recovery phases: Assets gradually disperse and diversify
• Sector rotation: Clusters shift as leadership changes
• Systemic risk: Persistent tight clustering reveals vulnerability

The geometric constraints (planarity, triangulation) aren't arbitrary - they balance information retention with interpretability, creating networks that are both statistically meaningful and visually comprehensible.

🎓 Research Foundation:

This implementation is based on 20+ years of research:
• Tumminello et al. (2005) - PMFG - PNAS (500+ citations)
• Massara et al. (2016) - TMFG - J. Complex Networks
• Mantegna (1999) - MST for finance - European Physical J.

The methods have been validated against real market data and successfully recover industrial sector classifications, demonstrating they capture genuine economic relationships.

🔧 Technical Features:

• Complete Python implementation (~1000 lines)
• Force-directed layout with smoothing algorithm
• Configurable parameters: smoothing (0-1), spacing (1-3)
• Works with all filtering methods (MST, PMFG, TMFG)
• Includes synthetic data generator with time-varying correlations
• Jupyter notebook with interactive examples
• Automated setup script
• Full documentation (40+ pages)
• Fully backward compatible

Perfect for:
→ Researchers studying market structure
→ Quants building risk models
→ Data scientists learning network theory
→ Professors teaching complex systems
→ Anyone presenting correlation dynamics

The code is production-ready with synthetic data, but also works seamlessly with real market data - just load your returns as a pandas DataFrame.

🙏 Huge acknowledgment to Tomaso Aste and colleagues for developing these elegant methods that bridge topology, geometry, and finance. Their work has fundamentally changed how we understand correlation structure in complex systems.

Would love feedback from the community:
• Have you used network filtering in your work?
• What other features would be valuable?
• Interested in real-time streaming data support?
• Want to see 3D visualizations?

The dynamic layouts transform static correlation matrices into living, breathing systems. You can literally watch the market's nervous system react to events.

P.S. The animations are particularly fascinating during volatile periods - you can see the market "tighten up" as correlations spike, then gradually relax as conditions normalize. It's correlation dynamics made visible.

UPDATE: Now includes comprehensive Jupyter notebook tutorial demonstrating both dynamic and static layouts, with parameter tuning examples and side-by-side comparisons. Perfect for learning!
